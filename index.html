    <h1>Simple Living Manifesto</h1>
    <p>A commitment to simplicity, sustainability, and holistic well-being</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>In a world increasingly driven by consumption, digital noise, and relentless technological progress, we choose a different path—one rooted in simplicity, mindful presence, and deep connection with ourselves, each other, and the natural world. We recognize that true well-being and fulfillment come not from more things or constant acceleration, but from living with intention, gratitude, and respect for the limits of our planet and our humanity.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Reduce Consumption:</strong> We commit to minimizing our material possessions and consumption habits. By owning less and buying only what is essential, we create space for what truly enriches our lives.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Mindful Technology Use:</strong> We embrace technology selectively and purposefully, using tools that enhance well-being and connection while rejecting those that foster distraction, dependency, or harm.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Financial Prudence and Freedom:</strong> We prioritize financial security through wise spending, avoiding debt, and focusing on sufficiency over accumulation of wealth or status.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Slow Living and Presence:</strong> We choose a slower pace—working fewer hours when possible, savoring simple pleasures, and cultivating presence in everyday moments.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong> We live in harmony with the Earth by conserving resources, reducing waste, supporting sustainable and local products, and protecting natural ecosystems.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Self-Sufficiency and Practical Skills:</strong> We develop skills that allow us to care for ourselves and our environment—growing food, repairing goods, and reducing reliance on complex systems.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Community and Connection:</strong> We nurture strong, supportive communities that value shared experiences, mutual aid, and collective well-being over isolation and competition.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Mindfulness and Inner Growth:</strong> We cultivate awareness, gratitude, and inner peace through reflection, spiritual practices, or connection with nature, recognizing that happiness arises from within.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Maintain Fitness and Simple Dieting:</strong> We honor our bodies by engaging in regular physical activity that is accessible and enjoyable, promoting health and vitality without excess. We adopt simple, wholesome eating habits focused on natural, minimally processed foods that nourish us while respecting ecological balance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>A world where simplicity is a respected choice, where people live in balance with nature and each other, and where progress is measured not by how much we own or consume but by the quality of life and depth of human connection.</p>

    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <p>We invite all who hear this manifesto to join us in reclaiming simplicity. Begin by examining your consumption, questioning the role of technology in your life, maintaining your physical well-being through movement and mindful eating, and seeking fulfillment through meaningful relationships and nature. Together, we can build a future that honors what is essential and sustainable.</p>
